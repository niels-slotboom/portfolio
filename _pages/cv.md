## Interests and Ambitions
<ul class="skill-list">
  <li>Deep interest in the analytical and geometric foundations of generalised metrised gravity, including constraint analysis and theoretical structures</li>
  <li>Strong engagement with numerical methods and high-performance computing, particularly in Maxwell theory and Bloch simulations, with interest in gravitational wave modelling and simulating compact sources using C++ and CUDA</li>
  <li>Motivated to develop tools that bridge theoretical physics and HPC, making complex simulations more accessible to researchers without specialised programming expertise</li>
</ul>
